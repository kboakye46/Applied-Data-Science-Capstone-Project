    " The consensus that is out there is that London and Toronto are two cities with uncanny similarity. Many assert that this public acclaim is nothing more than an urban myth while believers of this notion point to several linkages between the two cities. These two megacities are both considered financial strongholds of their countries. Adding to the obvious strong economy, these two countries are melting pots for different cultures.\n",

    "More specifically, one can observe the ubiquity of the Afro-Caribbean cultures like Jamaica, Trinidad, Ghana, and Nigeria that exist in certain pockets of the city. An attempt is made here to gain further understanding of the neighborhoods that exist in these cities by analyzing them using clustering techniques."

The Foursquare will allow the use of the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood and then use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. For Geolocation data, the Geocoder python package will help in providing the necessary latitude and longitude using the postal codes of the different neighborhoods in both cities.\n",
